# SDLOdin

SDLOdin is a simple SDL2-based application that demonstrates the creation of a window, rendering graphics, and handling user input. This project serves as a foundation for building more complex SDL applications.

## Features

- Create and manage an SDL window
- Render images using SDL2
- Handle keyboard events
- Clean-up resources properly

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) - Make sure you have Odin installed on your machine.
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) - You need to have SDL2 and SDL2_image installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SDLOdin.git
   cd SDLOdin
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # Instructions for installing SDL2 and SDL2_image
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   odin build main.odin
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it using the keyboard. Press the `ESC` key or close the window to exit.
